    Hi, I'm PEYTON. I'm an artist at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/y8nEwPytgNj1W3QC7" style="color: #9b59b6;">Base Camp Studios 2! </a>
  </p>

    Westlake, Northgate, SODO, Angle lake. Bumpy bus through Fremont. I'll be out in the rain at midnight or skating early in the morning at 6.

    I've missed the last airport light rail listening to rush hoping the directions I asked for were correct.

    Learning how to navigate everything. Listening to different communities and lifestyles. There's an old lady on the light-rail who wears a pastel like cat sweater, wire rimmed specs, and will talk to just about anyone regarding the books she's reading.

    Yesterday it was multiple on pterodactyls. Then plays solitaire. One lady dresses in high fashion from the 60s, even during heavy rain and winds. Heels, a gravely voice and a stiff posture that leans to the left.

  <p>
    A man walking along the yellow line plays guitar during rush hour. Three men playing with a happy dog. The barks echo around the station. Four teenagers jumping another, yelling, commotion. Someone lighting up in the train cart. Crowds on their way to a football game.
  </p>

  <p>
    Photoshoots, conductor switches, delays, power outages, and on and on and on.
